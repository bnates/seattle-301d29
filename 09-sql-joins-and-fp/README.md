=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

*The purpose of this class is to introduce the concepts of database normalization through the use of SQL joins. We will also begin to use FP (functional programming) methods to further abstract and interact with our code*
